I looked into my initial idea that instead of resizing mesh to block surface, we can just select 3 vertices of a surface and instantly
creating a mesh, but it looks like the service needed to get access to the vertices requires a higher security permission than Roblox
Studio Plugins have access to.

So then I looking to the security permissions for the codes to see if I can get around that without jailbreaking my studio (illegal), but
it looks like the permission for that is used by the CoreCode, which is a permission that only the code for the engine has access to, and 
the highest we have access to in plugins.

Found an interesting tutorial on how to make various Roblox Plugin Implementations, tested out a few of them in studio.


Week 3
Made a template of screen gui that fit what we want, still need to insert functionality. Need way to trigger the gui, can't have it just pop up.
